Add a batteries-included path for grouping capabilities into bundles without one filesystem package per group, so a host needs no bundling code of its own:

- `virtualDescriptors` on `resolveSelectedCapabilities`, `composeCapabilities` and the React `capabilityLoader`: host-provided descriptors that join the discovered set for graph resolution without living on disk. Grouping descriptors whose `dependencies` point at real capabilities take part in selection but carry no surface, so they emit no import and need no `package.json`.
- `loadBundleManifest({ cwd, fileName? })` in `@lorion-org/descriptor-discovery`: discovers a declarative bundle manifest (`{ base, default, bundles: [ { id, version, dependencies } ] }` — `bundles` is a nested list of ordinary descriptors, no bespoke format) by walking up from `cwd` and expands it into virtual descriptors plus the base/default seed. Each bundle descriptor is validated against the shared `descriptorSchema`, so a malformed grouping fails fast.
- `bundles: { cwd, fileName? }` on `composeCapabilities`, `resolveSelectedCapabilities` and the React `capabilityLoader`: the convenience wrapper that loads a manifest and fills `virtualDescriptors`, `baseDescriptors` and `defaultSelection`. Explicit values still win.
- `virtualDescriptorDirectory(workspaceRoot, id)` / `VIRTUAL_DESCRIPTOR_DIR` in `@lorion-org/descriptor-discovery`: the single shared convention for the synthetic directory a virtual descriptor is addressed at, so the runtime and build-time hosts no longer each hard-code the segment.
- `baseSeed` on the selection seed (`@lorion-org/descriptor-selection`, forwarded by `capability-composition` and `react`): a CLI/env override for `baseDescriptors`, symmetric to `selectionSeed`. A non-empty parse replaces `baseDescriptors`; otherwise `baseDescriptors` stands. `resolveBaseSelection` is exported for hosts that need the resolved base directly.
